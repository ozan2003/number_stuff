# Number Theory Utilities

This repo contains a collection of number theory utilities. The utilities are divided into the following categories:

1. Prime Numbers
    * Primality Testing
      * Trial Division method
      * Miller-Rabin primality test
    * Prime Generation
      * Sieve of Atkin
2. Factorization
    * Pollard's rho algorithm
    * Trial Division method
3. Number Theory Functions
    * Euler's Totient Function
    * Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
    * Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The project is divided into the 4 binaries:

1. `is_prime`: Tests whether a given number is prime using primality testing algorithms.
2. `factorize`: Decomposes numbers into their prime factors using factorization methods.
3. `primesieve`: Generates all prime numbers up to a specified limit.
4. `totient`: Calculates Euler's totient function Ï†(n), counting numbers coprime to n.
