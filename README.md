# Number Theory Utilities

This repo contains a collection of number theory utilities. The utilities are divided into the following categories:

1. Prime Numbers
    * Primality Testing
      * Trial Division method
      * Miller-Rabin primality test
    * Euler's Totient Function
    * Prime Generation
      * Sieve of Atkin
2. Factorization
    * Pollard's rho algorithm
    * Trial Division method

The project is divided into the 4 binaries:

1. `is_prime`: Contains primality testing
2. `factor`: Contains factorization utilities
3. `sieve`: Contains utilities related to prime generation
4. `totient`: Contains Euler's Totient Function
